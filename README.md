# üå¶Ô∏èRealTime Weather ETL Pipeline

A real-time ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) system using Kafka, Python, PostgreSQL, and Power BI to collect, process, store, and visualize weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## System Overview

This pipeline collects weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API for Vietnamese cities (Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang), processes it, stores it in PostgreSQL, and visualizes it through interactive Power BI dashboards for real-time weather monitoring.

### Data Flow:
1. **Producer** calls the OpenWeatherMap API to periodically fetch weather data
2. Data is pushed to **Kafka** for processing using the pub/sub model
3. **Consumer** receives and processes the data, then stores it in **PostgreSQL**
4. **Power BI** connects to the PostgreSQL database to create interactive dashboards

## Key Components

**weather_producer.py**: Fetches data from OpenWeatherMap API and sends it to Kafka
**weather_consumer.py**: Receives data from Kafka and stores it in PostgreSQL
**PostgreSQL**: Stores the processed weather data
**Kafka & Zookeeper**: Message queue system for real-time data processing
**Power BI**: Creates interactive dashboards for weather data visualization

## Installation and Usage

### Requirements

- Docker Desktop
- OpenWeatherMap account for API key (One Call API 3.0 in this project)
- Power BI Desktop (for dashboard development)

### Configuration

Replace `enter-your-api-key` in `.env` with your OpenWeatherMap API key (or you can use my api: 1bef61e5d3e122984de2d9b700f1e7f7)

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stopping the Application

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Technical Details

### Python Libraries Used

- **confluent-kafka**: Kafka interaction
- **psycopg2**: PostgreSQL connection
- **requests**: OpenWeatherMap API calls
- **pandas**: Data processing
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **pytz**: Timezone handling

### Kafka Configuration

The system uses Kafka as a reliable message broker, enabling real-time data processing with high scalability.

### Data Formatting

Weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API is transformed into an appropriate format before being stored in PostgreSQL, with timezone conversions to display in Vietnam time (UTC+7).

## Data Visualization with Power BI

The project includes a Power BI dashboard for real-time weather monitoring with the following features:

- Current weather conditions visualization
- Temperature and "feels like" temperature indicators
- UV index with low/high scale indicator
- Humidity percentage with visual gauge
- Atmospheric pressure in hPa
- Wind speed in km/h
- Visibility in kilometers
- Sunrise and sunset times
- Weather condition icons and descriptions
